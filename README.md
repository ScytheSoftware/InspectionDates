# InspectionDates

This program I created was for a family member.

This program lets Users enter, view, edit, and delete data from the list of inspection dates that was gathered.
You will enter a name for a building, the date you inspected it. It will give the option to save or not save the entry. If saved, it saves it to a Database file
You can then save all the data in the database into a cvs file
